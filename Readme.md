Please follow the following instructions to run this code:

1. Run the iRobot Simulator.

2. Place the relevant obstacle file in the same directory as the other .m files.

3. Also edit the name of the obstacle file in the path_planner.m 

4. Now load the path_planner.m file for autonomous navigation in the simulator.

Please note the start_point is (0,0) and goal is (10, 10)

Upon launching the path_planner.m a plot will pop-up which will show the implementation of a* search algorithm for the randomly generated points.

Please note, delibrate time delay as been introduced so that the plot can be easily visualised.

Upon, completion of the a* search the final robot path will be displayed on another plot.

Now, please switch back to the simulator window to see the robot execute the path.
